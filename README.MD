This repository contains a collection of shell scripting exercises developed during the course at the Steve Jobs Academy. The exercises cover various aspects of shell scripting, from basics to more advanced concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into thematic folders:

- **calculator/**: Calculation exercises
  - Equation solving
  - Calculation scripts

- **files/**: File manipulation
  - Array operations
  - Backup utilities
  - File comparison
  - File conversion
  - Report generation
  - File monitoring
  - Occurrence counting
  - File permission management
  - File sorting
  - Book library management

- **loop/**: Loop examples

## How to Use the Exercises

Each file contains a complete shell script that can be executed separately. To run an exercise, use the command:

```bash
bash path/to/script.sh
```

Or make the script executable and then run it:

```bash
chmod +x path/to/script.sh
./path/to/script.sh
```

## Exercise Examples

### File Manipulation
```bash
# Counting occurrences in a file
# Monitoring file changes
# Converting file formats
```

### Calculation Operations
```bash
# Solving equations
# Basic mathematical calculations
```

### Loops and Flow Control
```bash
# Infinite loops
# Iterating through arrays
```
